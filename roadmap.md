## Roadmap 

The Roadmap of the Smart Data Models Initiative is the following: 

* To launch its community not only in the github repository but also in a dedicated website

* Finish the integration of the testing tools for the decentralised approach of repositories

* Automation of the testing tools to check consistency within the data models
  * Check that all files are included
  * Check that all properties are included into the examples
 
* Adopt additional Data Models from: 
- [SynchroniCity Data Models Project](https://gitlab.com/synchronicity-iot/synchronicity-data-models)
- [Fiware4Water](https://www.fiware4water.eu/) belonging to the ICT4water cluster in Europe

* Launch other domains
- Smart Robotics
- Smart Manufacturing 

* Add additional Data Models per other methods defined by the FIWARE Foundation and TMForum. 

* Adopt automatic documentation generation to be developed by FIWARE Data Models. 
It hs been drafting a new template for generating this documentation. First example [here](https://github.com/smart-data-models/data-models/blob/master/templates/dataModel/doc/spec-example.md)

* Generate Schema definitions in JSON JSON-LD as suggested by 

* Validate NGSI-LD content.
The validation tool (see [tools repository](https://github.com/smart-data-models/tools)) has to be tweaked to perform NGSI-LD validation of examples
, once Orion-LD is in a more mature state.
